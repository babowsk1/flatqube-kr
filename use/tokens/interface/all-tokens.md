By going to the Tokens section, you will see a list of tokens used on FlatQube.

Here you have the following options:

**Sort tokens by TVL** - click on _TVL_ in the upper right corner of the token sheet to sort them by [TVL](token-page/tvl.md).

**Switch between pages** - in the lower right corner, by clicking on the arrows, you can switch between token pages.

**Go to a token page** - click on one of the tokens to go to that [token page](token-page/) with detailed information about it.
