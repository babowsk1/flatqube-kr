# Use cross-exchange

When you choose tokens to exchange, if there is not enough liquidity in the pool corresponding to these pairs, FlatQube will automatically offer to make a cross exchange.\
Keep in mind that since you are dealing with two pools at once, your [**slippage tolerance**](../concepts/slippage-tolerance.md), as well as [**liquidity provider fees**](../concepts/fees.md), will double.

The process of conducting a transaction does not differ from a[ **regular swap** ](make-a-basic-swap.md)- Click **Swap**, then **Confirm** and **confirm your transaction** in EVER Wallet.
