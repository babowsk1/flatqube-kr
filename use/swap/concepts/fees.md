# Fees

When making any swap, you need to pay some commissions:

* First, there is the Everscale **blockchain fee** that you pay when interacting with the contracts of the network.\
  Fees are one of the ways in which validators are rewarded for their work: fees from all transactions that have been included in newly created blocks are distributed among all participating validators.\
  Everscale network fees are negligible and are limited to a few cents when making swaps.
* Also, you pay a commission of 0.3% of the transaction amount to [providers ](../../getting-started/roles.md#liquidity-providers)that [provide liquidity](../../pools/how-to/add-liquidity.md) to the [pool ](../../pools/)of tokens that you exchange (**Liquidity Provider Fee**).\
  The amount of the commission is evenly distributed among all liquidity providers depending on their share in this pool, and they can take this reward by [removing their liquidity](../../pools/how-to/withdraw-liquidity.md) (burning LP tokens).
