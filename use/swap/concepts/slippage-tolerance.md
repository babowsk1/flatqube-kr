# Slippage tolerance

Slippage tolerance is the difference between the expected price of a token and its price at the time of the transaction.\
You can change this parameter by setting the maximum slippage when making a swap.\
Slippage tolerance will not allow a transaction to be completed if the price of the token at the time of its completion changes by more than the specified percentage.
