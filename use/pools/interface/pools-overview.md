# Pools Overview

By going to the Pools section, you will find yourself on the **Pools overview** page.\
All your favorite pools are displayed here.\
Clicking on <mark style="color:orange;">one of these pools</mark> will take you to the [**Pool page**](pool-page/).

Also, on the right side of the screen there are buttons to go to the section for <mark style="color:green;">**creating a new position and withdrawing liquidity**</mark>.

In addition to the name of the pool, it displays the number of LP tokens that make up your [locked liquidity](../how-to/add-liquidity.md), as well as the total amount of tokens you [locked](../how-to/create-new-position.md) as the left and right sides of the pair.
