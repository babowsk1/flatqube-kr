# Balances and prices

Directly below the name of the pool, the <mark style="color:green;">price of tokens</mark> in relation to each other is displayed. Clicking on one of them will take you to the [swap interface](../../../swap/).\
Below are 3 <mark style="color:orange;">**Your balance**</mark> blocks:

* **Total balance** displays the total amount of LP tokens of this pair associated with your DEX account - whether they are locked in [Farming pools](farming-pools.md) or are directly on the balance of the wallet. **Total LP breakdown** shows the amount of tokens that [make up your liquidity.](../../how-to/add-liquidity.md)\
  **Share** is your percentage of the liquidity locked in the pool, from its total amount (TVL of the pool).
* **The Wallet balance** displays information about the locked liquidity, which is directly on the balance of your DEX account in the form of LP tokens.
* **Locked in farming pools** shows information about your LP tokens locked in the [farming pools](../../../farming/interface/farming-pools.md) of this pair (farming tokens).
