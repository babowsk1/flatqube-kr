# Withdraw liquidity

In order to withdraw your tokens from the liquidity pool, you need to go to the **Remove liquidity** page. You can do this in two ways:

1. Open the [**Pools**](../) section and select <mark style="color:orange;">**Remove Liquidity**</mark> in the upper right corner. Then select the <mark style="color:green;">left and right token</mark> of the pair.

2\. In the [**Pools**](../) section, go to the [**Pool page**](../interface/pool-page/) of the desired pair by <mark style="color:green;">clicking on it</mark>. Then click <mark style="color:orange;">**Burn Liquidity**</mark> under **Your balance** block\*\*.\*\*

In both cases, the final page will be **Remove Liquidity** for the selected pair.

Here you can see your [**Pool Share**](../pool-economics.md) as well as the exact amount of tokens that make up your liquidity.

\
In order to withdraw liquidity from the pool, <mark style="color:green;">enter the amount of LP tokens to burn</mark>.\
In this case, you will see the <mark style="color:purple;">number of tokens</mark> that will return to your balance after this process is completed. At the bottom, your updated \*\*\*\* <mark style="color:orange;">Pool share and the number of tokens</mark> that will remain locked in the pool will be displayed.

Click **Confirm** to start the process of unlocking the tokens.

After confirming the transaction, you just have to wait for its execution.\
After the transaction is completed, you will see the **Transaction submitted** window. By clicking on View on TON Scan, you can go to the page of this transaction in the [blockchain explorer](../../getting-started/glossary.md#explorer).
