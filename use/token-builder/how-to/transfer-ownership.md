# Transfer ownership

You can transfer ownership of the token you created to any [Dex account](../../pools/how-to/connect-dex-account.md). To do this, you need to use the **Transfer ownership** interface.

Go to the [Builder section](../) and then to the [token page](../interface/token-page.md).\
On the right, in the <mark style="color:green;">**Actions block**</mark>, click **Transfer**.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that this action is irreversible and after the transfer of ownership is completed, you will not be able to manage this token.
{% endhint %}

Enter the address of the new owner of the token and click **Confirm**. Then click **Confirm transaction** in your EVER Wallet and wait for the transfer to complete.

At the end of the process, the token will disappear from the [**Builder section**](../) of the previous owner of the token and will be sent to the <mark style="color:green;">**current owner**</mark>:
