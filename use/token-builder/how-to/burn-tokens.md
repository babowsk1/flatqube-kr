# Burn tokens

If you want to reduce token supply, there is an interface for burning them.\
In order to burn part of created token supply, go to the [token page](../interface/token-page.md) in the [Builder section](../) and click on <mark style="color:green;">**Burn**</mark> in the right block of the page.

In the interface window that opens, fill in the appropriate fields:

* Enter the address from which the tokens will be burned in the **Target address** field.
* Enter the **amount to burn**
* Optionally enter **Callback address** and **Callback payload**\
  \*\*\*\*(In simple terms, a Ð¡allback address is an address of a smart contract that can use data from a Callback payload when a corresponding message arrives)

The bottom part of the window displays the number of tokens stored at the specified Target Address and the total supply of the token.

If you are ready to start the burning process, click **Burn**, confirm the transaction in your EVER Wallet and wait for the process to finish.

Upon completion, on the [token page](../interface/token-page.md), you will see that the **Supply** has changed:
