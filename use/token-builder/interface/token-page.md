# Token page

This is the created token's page. It contains all the basic information about it (<mark style="color:green;">**Description**</mark>), as well as the management interface (<mark style="color:orange;">**Actions**</mark>).

<mark style="color:green;">On the left side</mark>, you will see the following information about the token:\
**Network** - the network where the token is located\
**Root** - address of the token in the network\
**Token name** - full name of the token\
**Token symbol** - symbolic name of the token. It is roughly equivalent to a stock ticker\
**Decimal places** - technically speaking, the decimals value is the number of digits that come after the decimal place when displaying token values on-screen. Total supply indicates the total number of tokens in the network.
