# Farming speed

**Farming speed** determines the amount of tokens that are distributed among all farmers of the pool, as well as the distribution speed.\
Farming speed is displayed on the page of each farming pool in the [**Farming pool statistics block**](../interface/farm-page-user/statistics.md), while the reward distribution rate per second is displayed.\
Farming speed is assigned by the [pool administrator ](../interface/farm-page-administrator.md)and can be changed at will. The history of farming speed changes is displayed in the [**Farming speed changes block**](../interface/farm-page-user/farming-speed.md).

In order to better understand how the reward is distributed, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the [**Vesting** ](vesting.md)and [**Farming performance**](../interface/farm-page-user/farming-perfomance-and-balances.md) sections.
