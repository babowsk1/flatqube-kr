# Farming token

In order to become a farmer in a certain pool, you need to store a certain amount of **Farm tokens** in this pool or **Liquidity Provider** **(LP) tokens** of the corresponding [liquidity pool](../../pools/).

LP tokens represent a liquidity provider’s share of a pool.\
For example, if you contribute $10 USD worth of assets to a liquidity pool that has a total worth of $100, you would receive 10% of that pool’s LP tokens. You receive 10% of the LP tokens because you own 10% of the crypto liquidity pool. The LP tokens become your claim to your share of the pool’s assets. Holding these LP tokens gives you total control over when you withdraw your share of the pool without interference from anyone — even the FlatQube platform.

In exchange for locking liquidity in the form of LP tokens in a farming pool, farmers receive a [reward](reward-token.md), depending on their **share** in the pool.
