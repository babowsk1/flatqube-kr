# Farming pools

By going to the [**Farming** ](../concepts/yield-farming.md)section, you will find yourself on a page with a list of currently available Farming pools.\
If you previously [added liquidity](../how-to/deposit-farm-tokens.md) to one of the farming pools, then this pool will be displayed in the Favorite pools block.

This page also displays various columns with farm pool information:

**Farm pool** - those tokens that make up a pair for this farm pool. The [LP tokens](../../pools/how-to/add-liquidity.md) of this particular pair must be locked in the Farming pool in order to start receiving a reward.

**Reward** is the tokens that are awarded as a [reward for farming](../concepts/reward-token.md) in this pool.

**TVL** is the total dollar amount of tokens locked in this farming pool.

**APR** is the annual profit that this pool brings.

**Share** is your share in the farming pool. This is the percentage of the TVL that your locked liquidity constitutes.\
At the same time, Share also means the percentage of the reward that you will receive for every unit of time.

**Your reward** is the reward available for the [claim](../how-to/claim-reward.md).

**Entitled reward** is a reward that is in the [vesting](../concepts/vesting.md) protocol.

Clicking on one of these pools will take you to the [Farming pool page](farm-page-user/).
