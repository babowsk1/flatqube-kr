# Farming speed

This block displays the current **Farming speed**.\
Recall that farming pool administrators can change the speed, so the history of changes to this parameter is also displayed here.

**Farming speed** is the number of tokens that are distributed to all [farmers ](../../../getting-started/roles.md#farmers)every second, in proportion to their [pool share](farming-perfomance-and-balances.md).\
**Share** percentage means the percentage of the Reward that the farmer receives per second.
