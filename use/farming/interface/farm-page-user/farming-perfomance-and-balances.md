# Farming perfomance and balances

### My farming perfomance

This block displays information about your funds locked in this farm pool.

**Farming balance** displays the price of all your [locked ](../../how-to/deposit-farm-tokens.md)farming tokens in this pool at the moment in dollar terms.

**The breakdown of LP** tokens displays the amount of tokens that make up your LP at the moment. This number changes depending on the ratio of the prices of these tokens to each other.

**LP token** is the amount of locked LP tokens you are using to farm[ ](../../how-to/deposit-farm-tokens.md)in this farming pool.

**Share in farming pool** displays the percentage of your farming LPs from the total number locked in this farming pool. At the same time, it is a percentage of the total reward that you will receive at any given time.\
Let's say the **farming speed** of pool is 0.1$ per second and your Share in the farming pool is 10%. In this case, every second, 10% of $0.1 is transferred to [vesting ](../../concepts/vesting.md)and, accordingly, your **Entitled reward**, and your profitability is $0.01 per second or $36 per hour.\\
