# Transactions

The bottom block of the Farming pool page is the **transaction block**.

**The transaction block** displays all transactions associated with this Farming Pool.\
The types of these operations are divided into **Claims**, **Deposits**, **Withdrawals** and **Reward deposits**.

* \*\*\*\*[**Claims** ](../../how-to/claim-reward.md)- withdrawals of Unclaimed reward to the DEX account balance.
* \*\*\*\*[**Deposits** ](../../how-to/deposit-farm-tokens.md)- locking LP (faming) tokens in the pool.
* \*\*\*\*[**Withdrawals** ](../../how-to/withdraw-farm-tokens.md)- withdrawals of LP (farming) tokens from the pool.
* \*\*\*\*[**Reward deposits**](../../concepts/reward-token.md) - the addition of reward tokens by the pool administrator to the reward balance.

You can switch between filters for displaying transactions at the <mark style="color:green;">top of the block</mark>, as well as enable the <mark style="color:orange;">display mode</mark> of only those transactions that are linked to your DEX account.

In addition to transaction types, this block displays related information:

* **Total value** - the dollar equivalent of the amount of tokens that were added or withdrawn by this transaction.
* **Token**/**Left** and **Right Token** - the amount of left and right tokens added or withdrawn by this transaction.
* **LP token** - the amount of LP (farming) tokens added or withdrawn by this transaction.
* **Account** - the address of the account from which the transaction was made.
* **Time** - the time that has elapsed since the completion of the transaction.
