# Find my transactions

In order to find your transactions associated with a specific [**Farming Pool**](../interface/farming-pools.md), go to the [page of that Farming Pool](../interface/farm-page-user/) and navigate to the bottom of the page to the [**Transactions block**](../interface/farm-page-user/transactions.md). \\

In the upper-right corner of the block, check the box next to <mark style="color:green;">**Only my transactions**</mark> to display only transactions associated with your [DEX account](../../pools/how-to/connect-dex-account.md).\
For the convenience of finding the transaction you need, you can [filter them](../interface/farm-page-user/transactions.md) by type <mark style="color:orange;">at the top of the block.</mark>
