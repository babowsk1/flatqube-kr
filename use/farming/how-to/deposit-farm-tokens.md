# Deposit farm tokens

### Choose farming pool

In order to start farming, you need to select one of the pools from the list in the Farming section.

{% content-ref url="../interface/farming-pools.md" %}
[farming-pools.md](../interface/farming-pools.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Get LP tokens

After you have decided on the choice of the pool, you need to get LP tokens of the corresponding pair.\
To do this, you need to add liquidity to the pool of this pair.

{% content-ref url="../../pools/how-to/add-liquidity.md" %}
[add-liquidity.md](../../pools/how-to/add-liquidity.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Deposit LP tokens

Let's assume that we already have the corresponding tokens on the balance.\
In this case, we can start yield farming.

1. Go to the [page of the desired Farming pool](../interface/farm-page-user/).
2. In the Farming balance block, enter the amount of LP tokens that you want to lock in farming.
3. Click **Deposit** and confirm transaction in EVER Wallet.
4. After the transaction is completed, the pool page will change and you will see a new block - [My farming performance](../interface/farm-page-user/#my-farming-performance-and-farming-balances).
