# Exchange rates

<mark style="color:orange;">The exchange rate</mark> is the ratio of the left token (X) of the pair to the right one (Y), that is, the number of Y tokens that we can exchange for one X token and vice versa.\
There is a <mark style="color:orange;">graph</mark> on the pair's page, thanks to which it is possible to track changes in this ratio.

You can switch between chart display modes: <mark style="color:green;">by hours (H) and by days (D)</mark> for more convenient tracking of rate changes, as well as between <mark style="color:purple;">token ratio</mark> display modes (Left/Right or Right/Left).
