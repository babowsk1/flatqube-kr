# Glossary

## **Swap**

Exchange operation.

## **Token**

A type of crypto asset. There are two main types of tokens on FlatQube:

* **Native tokens** are presented in the [**Tokens** section](../tokens/). All of them have a certain price. You can buy, sell and exchange them, as well as provide liquidity to pools through them.
* **LP tokens** are a confirmation of the liquidity locked by the user in a certain [pool ](../pools/)and they can be used for [liquidity farming](../farming/).

## **Farming**

Yield farming or liquidity mining is a way of earning through rewards by **providing liquidity** (as **LP tokens**) to **farming pools**.

## **Farming pool**

A special smart contract that distributes the provided amount proportionally to everyone who staked a specific LP token on this contract.

## **Liquidity pool**

A collection of funds locked in a smart contract. Users called "**liquidity providers"** add two tokens in a certain proportion to a pool to create a market. As a confirmation of the provided liquidity, providers receive **LP tokens** that they can use in **Farming pools**.

## **Pair**

A pair of tokens that form a liquidity pool.

## **Vesting**

Essentially, vesting on FlatQube is a formula for progressively unlocking farming rewards over time.

## **Volume**

The trading volume (total number of exchanges) in USD for a certain period of time.

## **TVL**

The total value locked - is the value of assets locked by liquidity providers in a particular pool.

## **Account**

The personal smart contract of the liquidity provider, which they use to deposit tokens into the pool.

## **Vault**

A dedicated smart contract that stores all tokens deposited to the DEX.

## **Builder**

FlatQube interface that allows users to create their own tokens.

## **Explorer**

A [graphic user interface](https://tonscan.io) designed to allow users to analyze the Everscale blockchain.

A blockchain explorer is like a search engine that reveals information about the past and current state of a blockchain.

Through its interface, a user can browse information about blocks that have been added to the blockchain, transactions and messages that have occurred, account balances, and information about tokens.

## **Slippage tolerance**

The difference between the expected price of the token and its price at the time of the transaction. By changing this parameter, you can set the maximum slippage when making a transaction. The transaction will not go through if the price of the token at the time of its completion changes by more than the specified percentage.
